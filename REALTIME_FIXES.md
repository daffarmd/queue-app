# Real-time Updates & Voice Announcement Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Voice Output Not Working

**Problem**: Voice announcements were not triggered because WebSocket events weren't reaching the display page.

**Solution Applied**:

-   ✅ Added polling-based voice announcements as fallback
-   ✅ Enhanced `PublicDisplay` component with `checkForNewCalls()` method
-   ✅ Added debugging to voice announcement script
-   ✅ Implemented proper Laravel Reverb WebSocket server

### 2. No Real-time Updates Between Pages

**Problem**: Changes in staff management page weren't reflected in display page without manual refresh.

**Solution Applied**:

-   ✅ Installed Laravel Reverb for WebSocket broadcasting
-   ✅ Configured proper broadcasting with Laravel Events
-   ✅ Added fallback polling system (5-second intervals)
-   ✅ Updated environment configuration for Reverb

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### A. Polling Fallback System

**File**: `resources/views/livewire/public-display.blade.php`

```javascript
// Check for new calls every 5 seconds with voice announcements
setInterval(() => {
    if (typeof Livewire !== "undefined") {
        Livewire.dispatch("checkForNewCalls");
    }
}, 5000);
```

**File**: `app/Livewire/PublicDisplay.php`

```php
public function checkForNewCalls()
{
    $previousQueue = $this->currentQueue;
    $this->refreshDisplay();

    // If there's a new current queue, announce it
    if ($this->currentQueue && (!$previousQueue || $this->currentQueue->id !== $previousQueue->id)) {
        $this->dispatch('announceQueue', [
            'message' => "Queue {$this->currentQueue->code}, {$this->currentQueue->patient_name}, please come to counter {$this->currentQueue->counter}",
        ]);
    }
}
```

### B. Laravel Reverb WebSocket Setup

**Environment Configuration** (`.env`):

```env
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb

REVERB_APP_ID=local-app-id
REVERB_APP_KEY=local-app-key
REVERB_APP_SECRET=local-app-secret
REVERB_HOST=127.0.0.1
REVERB_PORT=8080
REVERB_SCHEME=http
```

**WebSocket Server**:

```bash
php artisan reverb:start
```

### C. Voice Announcement Enhancement

**File**: `resources/views/layouts/display.blade.php`

-   Added console logging for debugging
-   Enhanced error handling
-   Indonesian voice preference with fallback

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Development (Current Setup):

1. **Polling System**: Already active with 5-second intervals
2. **Voice Announcements**: Work automatically when queues are called
3. **No additional setup required** - works out of the box

### For Production (Real-time WebSockets):

1. **Start Reverb Server**:

    ```bash
    php artisan reverb:start
    ```

2. **Keep Server Running**:

    ```bash
    # Background process
    nohup php artisan reverb:start > reverb.log 2>&1 &

    # Or use process manager like Supervisor
    ```

3. **Verify Connection**:
    - Open browser console on display page
    - Should see: "Echo initialized for TRI MULYO Queue System"
    - Look for WebSocket connection logs

## 📊 Testing Results

### Polling System (Fallback):

-   ✅ Updates display every 5 seconds
-   ✅ Voice announcements work for new calls
-   ✅ Works without WebSocket server
-   ✅ Reliable across different browsers/tabs

### WebSocket System (Real-time):

-   ✅ Laravel Reverb server installed
-   ✅ Broadcasting events configured
-   ✅ Instant updates when working
-   ✅ Voice announcements on real-time events

## 🎯 Key Features Now Working

1. **Voice Announcements**:

    - ✅ Triggered automatically when queue is called
    - ✅ Indonesian language preference
    - ✅ Proper fallback to default voice
    - ✅ Console debugging available

2. **Real-time Updates**:

    - ✅ Polling fallback (5-second intervals)
    - ✅ WebSocket real-time (when server running)
    - ✅ Works across multiple browser tabs
    - ✅ Automatic refresh of all queue data

3. **Cross-Page Communication**:
    - ✅ Staff page actions → Display page updates
    - ✅ Queue creation → Immediate display refresh
    - ✅ Queue calling → Voice announcement + display update

## 🔍 Debugging

### Voice Issues:

1. Open browser console on display page
2. Look for "Voice announcement triggered" messages
3. Check "Speech synthesis not supported" errors
4. Verify browser allows autoplay/speech

### WebSocket Issues:

1. Check if Reverb server is running: `ps aux | grep reverb`
2. Verify port 8080 is accessible: `curl localhost:8080`
3. Look for Echo connection logs in browser console
4. Check Laravel logs for broadcasting errors

### Polling Issues:

1. Verify Livewire is loaded: Check for `typeof Livewire` in console
2. Look for "checkForNewCalls" dispatch calls
3. Check network tab for Livewire requests every 5 seconds

## 🎉 Final Status

**Both Issues Resolved**:

-   ✅ Voice output working with polling fallback
-   ✅ Real-time updates working with 5-second polling
-   ✅ WebSocket infrastructure ready for production
-   ✅ Comprehensive debugging and error handling added

The system now works reliably in both development and production environments!
